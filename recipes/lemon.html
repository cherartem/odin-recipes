    <title>Candied Lemon Peel</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Candied Lemon Peel</h1>
    <p>This is a good way to use up lemon rind and it goes good with coffee or on cake. It really does taste like candy, and you can do this to ANY citrus fruit. If you use oranges you can add brandy, cloves or other spices the mixture. Chop it up and put it in cookies, or just eat it by itself. </p>

        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><p>Cut lemons into slices about 1/4 inch thick and remove the fruit pulp. Cut the rings in half so the peels are in long strips.</p></li>
            <li><p>Bring water and lemon peel to a boil in a small pan. Drain water, and repeat with fresh cold water. Repeat the boiling step three times (see Editor's Note). Drain and set peels aside.</p></li>
            <li><p>Combine 2 cups fresh water with 2 cups sugar. Bring to a boil, stirring to dissolve the sugar. Reduce heat to low and stir in citrus peels; simmer until the white pith is translucent. Store peels in syrup, refrigerated, to keep them soft, or allow them to dry. Toss dry candied peels in additional sugar and store airtight at room temperature.</p></li>

        <h3>Editor's Note: </h3>
        <p>If you use grapefruit peel, change the water and boil the peels about five times to remove the bitterness. For orange peel, one boiling is usually enough.</p>
